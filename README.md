# Candyland

## Project Overview

A simple browser-based version of the Candyland board game. Moves are made by clicking a "Draw" button to draw a card that indicates the color square the player moves to. The first player to make it to the end of the board wins.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to start a new game at any time.

2. As a user, I play a turn by:

* Clicking the Draw button to draw a card
* Clicking the correct square based on the drawn cards color.

3. As a user, I want to see a celebratory message when I win the game by reaching the final square.

### MVP Goals

1. As a user I want to play a turn by clicking a Draw button to have my game piece moved to the corresponing color square on the card.

2. As a user, I want to play against a friend in 2 player mode.

3. As a user I want to win the game by landing on the Star Square at the end of the board (which will be reached by any color).

### Stretch Goals

1. As a user, I want to be required to correctly choose the square indicated by the card before my game piece is moved to it.

2. As a user, I want to have a chance to draw "double square" cards that allow me to move to the second square of that color.

3. As a user, I want the possibility of landing on a "Licourice Space" that makes the player stuck for one turn to make the game more exciting.
